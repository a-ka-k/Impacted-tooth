The project includes two parts.
The first part in python is the body of this model to predict the prognosis of the impacted tooth.
Here are the steps.
1.You need to submit the segementation model of impacted tooth in STL format.
2.You need three parts to ensure the model to execute successfully,the impacted tooth,the corresponding tooth on the opposite side,the alveolar bone.
3.You need to pre-install the required modules.
The second part in HTML is the visualized page of this model,it is half-done currently,please waiting for more updates.
